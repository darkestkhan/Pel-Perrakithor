This repository contains (well, it will) all the materials about
Pel Perraktihor, which is language used by Stonebreakers and Hammerwielders
(aka Dwarves) in PlaneShift universum.
This language was originally created by Arka.

Currently it is only dictionary containing most of the words currently present
in Pel Perrakithor.

As for informations about PlaneShift visit <planeshift.it> ;)
